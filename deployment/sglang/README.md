# SGLang

SGLang is a high-performance serving framework for large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs). By co-designing the backend runtime and a frontend language, it delivers faster and more controllable interactions. See the [SGLang repository](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang) for details.
